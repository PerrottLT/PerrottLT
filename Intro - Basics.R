# R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about.
# Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result.

# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6 + 12

#Arithmetic with R

# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

# A division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2 ^ 5

# Modulo
28 %% 6

#Variable assignment

#A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable. 

#A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable. 

# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges

#print my_fruit
my_fruit

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE

#What's that data type?

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
